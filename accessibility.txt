# PUI-Final-Project

accessibility notes:

1. using the alt text for each image and trying to be descriptive about it 
2. making the hover for the cursor option expand into the whole cell and not just the svg shape (bubble cursor kinda)
3. making the map the largest part of the screen
minimizing the nagivation into 3 main pages, and having all the contact links needed on the first page
making the map grid in a way that is easy to update for new projects by essentially adding or taking away cells and linking them to project pages.
